# Right2Restrooms
<!-- Good 1-liner -->
Right2Restrooms is a web application that allows users to find nearby public restrooms, filter for accessbility, and add new reviews and restrooms to our database.

I am currently working on authorizations and adding a rating system.

## Code Review Feedback
- weird files in project root `6}` and `10,`
- add setup instructions for a developer ramping onto this project (eg db setup, sample data, etc.)
- good focused, concise controllers
- good ids on html elements
- seems like using a framework like bootstrap to start and then adding custom as needed would be an easier approach
- please read this https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#understanding-yield
